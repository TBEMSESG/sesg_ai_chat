Here in Switzerland, numbers with decimals are written as ?22.80? with a ?dot? as the linker. -	During the import, DataLink removes the decimal parts, and adds only the INT part, as VARCHAR to the service.

 Resolving as per our policy. As per comment from L4, there are two options to handle the issue: 
 1.Add Apostrophe (') to number so that it reads it as String. 
 2.Instead of above step you can just save file as .csv instead excel. As csv file supports every type.
